Phase 1: Foundation Setup
Step 1: Define Requirements and Architecture
Identify specific use cases (e.g., task automation, dynamic inventory management, tool integration).
Finalize the architecture, including:
Frontend: Chat and configuration dashboard.
Backend: LLM, task orchestrator, and execution engine.
Integration APIs: Ansible, GitHub, Docker, SonarQube, and others.
Step 2: Choose Technology Stack
Backend: Python (LLM and orchestration) + Java JSP (frontend integration).
Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS for the web interface, with a chatbot interface.
Model: Use a pre-trained LLM like GPT or fine-tune it for task automation.
Step 3: Set Up Development Environment
Install and configure development tools (IDE, Git).
Prepare required infrastructure (e.g., Linux/Windows environments for testing).
Install necessary libraries and frameworks for AI, web, and tool integration.
Phase 2: Core System Development
Step 4: Develop Chat Interface
Build a chatbot for task inputs and communication using APIs or open-source frameworks.
Connect the chatbot to the LLM backend for understanding and task execution.
Step 5: Build Configuration Dashboard
Create a form-based interface to input structured data.
Design intuitive controls for inventory selection, tool parameters, and workflow execution.
Step 6: Implement LLM Brain
Integrate a pre-trained LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT or Hugging Face model).
Train or fine-tune the LLM for:
Task orchestration (interpreting commands, writing playbooks, and scripts).
Adaptability to new tools via self-learning patterns.
Enable API communication for task handling and error management.
Step 7: Develop Task Orchestrator
Handle user input from both the chatbot and dashboard.
Translate inputs into actions (e.g., running playbooks, cloning Git repos).
Prioritize tasks and manage dependencies between them.
Step 8: Integrate Tool APIs
Ansible: Handle inventory files, playbooks, and group/host selections.
GitHub: Enable repository access and branch handling.
SonarQube: Configure for code quality analysis.
Docker: Automate container creation and orchestration.
Phase 3: Execution and Feedback
Step 9: Build Execution Engine
Develop scripts to run tasks on the backend (e.g., deploying code, running scans).
Handle different operating systems (Linux/Windows).
Step 10: Real-Time Monitoring
Collect logs and task statuses during execution.
Send results back to the frontend (both chat and dashboard).
Phase 4: Adaptability and AI-Driven Expansion
Step 11: Enhance LLM for Self-Learning
Train the model to adapt to new tools or tasks by analyzing documentation and APIs.
Enable dynamic code generation for unhandled interfaces.
Step 12: Build Extensibility Features
Allow users to upload binaries or provide configuration files for unsupported applications.
Develop logic to handle these custom cases seamlessly.
Phase 5: Testing and Deployment
Step 13: Comprehensive Testing
Unit test each module (chat, dashboard, LLM, orchestrator).
Conduct integration tests for cross-module workflows.
Perform system tests on both Linux and Windows platforms.
Step 14: Deployment Packaging
Compress the application into a tar.gz format for easy installation.
Write setup scripts for Linux and Windows.
Step 15: Real-World Testing
Deploy in a controlled environment and gather feedback.
Optimize workflows based on user feedback.
Phase 6: Continuous Improvement
Step 16: Add Security Tool Integration
Support tools like Tenable, Nessus, and Splunk for monitoring and compliance.
Step 17: Incorporate Advanced Features
Integrate CI/CD pipelines.
Add support for monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
Step 18: Documentation and Training
Write detailed user guides and API documentation.
Offer tutorials and examples for usage.

- Integrate with Deployment Platform: Vultr.com 
- Trigger Deployments from GitHub Actions using the deployment job.

4. Additional information
•	Optimize the Workflow: 
o	Employ caching, parallel execution to run tests concurrently, and other techniques to accelerate build times.
o	Use container registry like Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry to store the container images.
o	Implement a robust monitoring and alerting system to track the health of the applications.
o	Configure the project's environment variables (e.g., API keys, database credentials).
•	Continuous Improvement: 
o	Regularly review and refine the CI/CD pipeline to enhance its efficiency and effectiveness.

Manual Approval for Production Deployment
To ensure deployments to production require manual approval, we can use the workflow_run event with workflow_dispatch for manual triggers.

Using CI/CD Pipelines for Instrumentation
Purpose:
•	CI/CD integration ensures that the setup, deployment, and configuration of monitoring tools happen automatically, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistency across environments. Whenever developers develop APIs or integrate functions, the instrumentation is already in place.
When to Use:
•	Automation: Ideal for automating the instrumentation setup across all environments.
•	Consistency: Ensures that every deployment has consistent monitoring and logging configurations.
•	Scalability: Suitable for large teams and projects where manual setup would be tedious.
How It Works:
•	The CI/CD pipeline automatically installs the necessary libraries and inserts instrumentation code during the build/deployment process.
•	Developers write their code, and when they push changes, the CI/CD system ensures the instrumentation is in place before deploying the application.

Install Graylog:
•	Docker Installation: This is the simplest method.
sh
docker run --name mongo -d mongo:3
docker run --name elasticsearch -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 \
-e ES_JAVA_OPTS="Xms2g -Xmx4g" -e discovery.type=single-node \
-e xpack.security.enabled=false -e bootstrap.memory_lock=true \
-d docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:5.6.11
docker run --name graylog --link mongo --link elasticsearch \
-p 9000:9000 -p 12201:12201 -p 514:514 -p 5555:5555 \
-e GRAYLOG_WEB_ENDPOINT_URI="http://127.0.0.1:9000/api" \
-d graylog/graylog:2.4.6-1
•	Access Graylog: Open your browser and go to http://localhost:9000/. The default username and password are both admin.
Configure Graylog Inputs:
•	Go to System > Inputs and launch a new input.
•	Select Syslog UDP and configure it to collect logs from your applications.

Setting Up Prometheus with Grafana for Monitoring
Install Prometheus and Node Exporter:
•	Node Exporter: Collects hardware and OS-level metrics.
sh
docker run -d --name node-exporter -p 9100:9100 prom/node-exporter
•	Prometheus: The monitoring system.
sh
docker run -d --name prometheus -p 9090:9090 \
-v $(pwd)/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
prom/prometheus

Configure Prometheus:
•	Create a prometheus.yml file with the following content:
yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'node'
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:9100']
•	Place this file in the same directory as your Prometheus container.

Install and Configure Grafana:
•	Docker Installation:
sh
docker run -d --name grafana -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana
o	Access Grafana: Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000/. Log in with the default credentials (username: admin, password: admin).

•	Add Prometheus as a Data Source in Grafana:
o	Go to Configuration > Data Sources and click Add data source.
o	Select Prometheus and set the URL to http://prometheus:9090.
o	Click Save & Test to verify the connection.

•	Create Dashboards:
o	Import pre-made dashboards or create your own to visualize the metrics collected by Prometheus.
Suitable Standard Libraries
For Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript):
•	Prometheus Client: prom-client for metrics.
•	OpenTelemetry: @opentelemetry/api, @opentelemetry/node, @opentelemetry/tracing for distributed tracing.
•	APM Tools: New Relic, Datadog APM, or Sentry for application performance monitoring.
For Python:
•	Prometheus Client: prometheus_client for metrics.
•	OpenTelemetry: opentelemetry-api, opentelemetry-sdk, opentelemetry-instrumentation for distributed tracing.
•	APM Tools: New Relic, Datadog APM, or Sentry for application performance monitoring.

Example: In a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline, you might have steps to install monitoring libraries and run scripts to add instrumentation:
yaml
- name: Add Instrumentation
  run: |
    echo "Adding OpenTelemetry Instrumentation"
    npm install @opentelemetry/api @opentelemetry/node @opentelemetry/tracing prom-client
    # Insert additional instrumentation code here if needed




4. Store and Monitor the Data
Use Prometheus to scrape and store the metrics, and visualize them in Grafana. For comprehensive analysis, you can also store the logs in a centralized logging system like Elasticsearch or Logstash.

Example Prometheus Metric Collection:
yaml
- job_name: "apisix"
  scrape_interval: 15s
  metrics_path: "/apisix/prometheus/metrics"
  static_configs:
    - targets: ["apisix-quickstart:9091"]

Correlate Data for Analysis
To correlate the data and identify problematic services and accounts:
1.	Set Up Dashboards: Create Grafana dashboards to visualize the metrics and logs. Use the transaction UUID and user/client information to filter and analyze the data.
2.	Analyze Logs: Use a centralized logging system to analyze the logs. Search for specific transaction UUIDs to trace the full path of a transaction.
3.	Alerting: Set up alerts in Grafana or Zabbix to notify you of issues, such as high error rates or slow response times.

Example Grafana Dashboard Configuration
Create a Grafana dashboard to display metrics like:
•	API Latency: Time taken for each API call.
•	Error Rates: Percentage of failed transactions.
•	Retries: Number of retries for each transaction.
•	User Activity: Number of transactions per user/client.

Example Alert Rule
Set up an alert rule in Grafana for high error rates:
yaml
alert:
  name: HighErrorRate
  condition: avg(5m, rate(http_request_total{status!~"2.."}[1m])) > 0.05
  for: 5m
  labels:
    severity: "critical"
  annotations:
    summary: "High Error Rate"
    description: "The error rate has been above 5% for the past 5 minutes."

import { logApiRequest, logApiResponse, sendAlert } from '../utils/apiUtils';

const requestWithRetries = async (userId, endpoint, retries = 3) => {
    const requestId = await logApiRequest(userId, endpoint);
    let attempts = 0;
    let response;
    while (attempts < retries) {
        attempts += 1;
        try {
            response = await fetch(endpoint);
            if (response.ok) {
                await logApiResponse(requestId, 'success', attempts);
                return await response.json();
            } else {
                await logApiResponse(requestId, 'fail', attempts);
                await sendAlert(requestId, 'error', `Request to ${endpoint} failed with status ${response.status}`);
            }
        } catch (error) {
            await logApiResponse(requestId, 'error', attempts);
            await sendAlert(requestId, 'error', `Request to ${endpoint} failed with error ${error.message}`);
        }
    }
    throw new Error(`Failed to fetch from ${endpoint} after ${retries} attempts`);
};

export default requestWithRetries;

4. Notifications and Alerts
Use a service like Twilio or SendGrid to send notifications. Here’s an example using SendGrid:
javascript
// utils/notificationService.js
import sgMail from '@sendgrid/mail';

sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

export const sendNotification = async (email, subject, text) => {
    const msg = {
        to: email,
        from: 'your-email@example.com',
        subject,
        text,
    };
    await sgMail.send(msg);
};

5. Graphical Display and Monitoring
Use a frontend library like Chart.js or D3.js to display the logs and alerts.
javascript
// components/ApiStatsChart.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { Line } from 'react-chartjs-2';
import { nhost } from '../utils/nhost';

const ApiStatsChart = () => {
    const [data, setData] = useState([]);
    useEffect(() => {
        const fetchData = async () => {
            const result = await nhost.graphql.request(`
                query {
                    api_requests(order_by: {created_at: desc}, limit: 50) {
                        request_time
                        response_time
                        status
                    }
                }
            `);
            setData(result.data.api_requests);
        };
        fetchData();
    }, []);

    const chartData = {
        labels: data.map((req) => req.request_time),
        datasets: [
            {
                label: 'Response Time',
                data: data.map((req) => new Date(req.response_time).getTime() - new Date(req.request_time).getTime()),
                borderColor: 'rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)',
                backgroundColor: 'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.2)',
                fill: false,
                tension: 0.1,
            },
        ],
    };

    return <Line data={chartData} />;
};

export default ApiStatsChart;

6. Highlight Abnormal Behaviors
Add logic to highlight abnormal behaviors based on thresholds.
javascript
// utils/anomalyDetection.js
export const detectAnomalies = (requests) => {
    const threshold = 2000; // 2 seconds
    return requests.filter(req => (new Date(req.response_time).getTime() - new Date(req.request_time).getTime()) > threshold);
};
